# Shortover

Media as overlay per global shortcut.

## Setup

Using https://www.electronforge.io/

## Shortcuts

The default shortcut is `Control+S+C`, if you want to show "Thanks" you have to press `Control + S + C + 2`. This application is designed to be used with a Streamdeck and as I don't want to interfere with other global shortcuts I decided to prefix them with SC :)

Currently, the following Gifs are included:
* `1` Party hard
* `2` Thanks
* `3` Hello
* `4` Confetti
* `5` See you soon Dwayne
* `6` See you Spongebob
  
  If you have a special gif which takes more or less time than the default duration (`DEFAULT_DISPLAY_TIME`) you can set a `displayTime` for each media element.

## Todos

- [ ] Add configuration screen: Add Media with shortcuts and duration, Change default duration, Change base shortcut
- [ ] Read file dimensions and adapt window for each media file
